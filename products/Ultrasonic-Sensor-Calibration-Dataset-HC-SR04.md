Ultrasonic Sensor Calibration Dataset — HC-SR04 (Arduino + Oscilloscope Validation)
A complete multi-test calibration dataset for the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, collected using both Arduino timing measurements and an oscilloscope for high-accuracy reference values. Ideal for students, robotics hobbyists, and anyone validating distance sensors.

**Included Data (6 Sheets Total)**
- Oscilloscope-based distance measurement
- Real distance (cm)
- Time-of-flight (μs)
- Calculated ultrasonic distance
- Arduino-based ranging tests (3 datasets)
- Multiple trials per distance
- Raw pulse timing (μs)
- Arduino-calculated distances
