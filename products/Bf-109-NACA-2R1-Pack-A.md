# NACA 2R1 Derived Airfoil — Single Section Pack (Root / Mid / Tip Options) | Me 109 Wing Geometry Dataset
Choose one precision-reconstructed NACA 2R1-family airfoil section from the historical Messerschmitt Bf 109 wing. Includes coordinates, plots, Excel workbook, CSV data, reference material, and a clean STL 3D model of the aerofoil.

## Overview
This package provides one (1) professionally reconstructed airfoil section from the Messerschmitt Bf 109 wing, derived from the NACA 2R1 modified profile.
Every dataset is reverse-engineered using digitized references, chamber/thickness analysis, and clean re-plotted coordinate extraction.

You may choose any 1 of these sections:

- 14.2% Root
- 12.8% Mid (Bf 109 E / Emil)
- 12.9% Mid (Bf 109 G / Gustav)
- 11.35% Tip (Bf 109 G / Gustav)
- 11.0% Tip (Bf 109 E / Emil)

This pack is meant for students, hobbyists, 3D modelers, and researchers who need a single airfoil section for modeling, printing, CNC, CFD, or comparison studies.
