**Complete Ohm’s Law & Kirchhoff Circuit Experiment Dataset**
Real laboratory measurements collected from a university electronics practical session.

Includes raw data and simulation values for:
- Ohm’s Law Test (measured V–I behavior of resistors & light bulb load)
- Voltage Divider Circuit (expected vs measured node voltages)
- Current Divider Circuit (expected vs measured branch currents)
- All data is neatly arranged in Excel with labeled columns and experiment notes.

**Perfect for:**
- Homework / lab report preparation
- Teaching materials
- Circuit analysis validation
- Practice with error analysis or plotting

Contents:
- 4 experiment sheets
- 1 Excel file
- Simulation vs measured values
- Light bulb load behavior
- Divider circuits with R1/R2 values provided



**Benefits**
Save time recreating basic EE experiments
Ready for graphing, report writing, or circuit comparison
Real-world measurement noise included (good for analysis practice)
