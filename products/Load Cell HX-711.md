Load Cell (2 kg) Calibration Dataset
- 2 kg Load Cell Calibration Dataset — HX711 Amplifier + Arduino Acquisition
- (BF-350 Strain Gauge Wheatstone Bridge Load Cell)

This dataset contains the complete calibration results for a 2 kg load cell using the HX711 24-bit amplifier/ADC and an Arduino micro-controller. The calibration factor was derived from repeated controlled loading tests conducted during a university thesis project.
 
The load cell is based on BF-350 foil strain gauges, arranged in a full Wheatstone Bridge configuration, providing high sensitivity to deformation under load. The data totaling 64 different weight with 10 times measurements each done twice for the repeatability.

** What’s Included**
  
You receive a structured Excel dataset containing:
 
1. Raw HX711 Output Data
- Unconverted HX711 24-bit readings
- Multiple trials for each weight step
- Data captured from Arduino serial output
- Zero-load baseline noise data

2. Known Mass Reference Values
- Calibration weights from 50 g → 2 kg
- Incremental loading and unloading cycles
- Repeated trials to assess hysteresis, linearity, and repeatability

3. Derived Calibration Factors
- Calibration factor (counts per gram / grams per count)
- Linear regression equation for direct force conversion
- Error analysis, max deviation, standard deviation

4. Graph-Ready Tables
- Clean processed data for plotting
- Linearization curves
- Residual error curves
- Stability vs. time samples

5. Experiment Notes
- Load cell construction (BF-350 strain gauges)
- Wheatstone Bridge wiring configuration
- Conditioning with HX711 (GAIN=128)
- Stress application setup
- Observed drift, noise, and temperature considerations

**Use Cases**
This dataset is ideal for:
- Robotics and mechatronics load measurement
- Custom weighing scales
- Force measurement systems
- Research on low-cost load cells
- Validating or teaching calibration methodology
- Comparing different ADC gain settings
- Thesis or lab report reference data
  
**Experiment Summary**
Calibration was conducted using a stable rig with verified reference masses.
Each weight step includes:
- Multiple repeated readings
- Averaged values
- Noise distribution
- Regression-based calibration factor extraction
The dataset captures real-world behavior of a budget load cell + HX711 system—including drift, repeatability, and linearity—making it a valuable reference for engineering students, makers, and researchers.
