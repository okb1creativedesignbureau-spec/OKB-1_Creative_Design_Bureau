    Load Cell (2 kg) Calibration Dataset
    2 kg Load Cell Calibration Dataset — HX711 Amplifier + Arduino Acquisition
    (BF-350 Strain Gauge Wheatstone Bridge Load Cell)
<br>
    This dataset contains the complete calibration results for a 2 kg load cell using the HX711 24-bit amplifier/ADC and an Arduino micro-controller. The calibration factor was derived from repeated controlled loading tests conducted during a university thesis project.
<br>    
    The load cell is based on BF-350 foil strain gauges, arranged in a full Wheatstone Bridge configuration, providing high sensitivity to deformation under load. The data totaling 64 different weight with 10 times measurements each done twice for the repeatability.
