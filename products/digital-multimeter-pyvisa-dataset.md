You get Python code, real hardware data, voltage divider experiments, potentiometer error characterization, and complete statistical comparison between DMM vs PyVISA readings.

**What’s Inside (Full Contents)**
1. NI-VISA + PyVISA Setup File
Includes:
- Full connection instructions
- DAQ workflow with DMM
Python code to:
- Detect VISA instruments
- Query IDN?
- Measure resistance
- Measure DC voltage
- Export measurements to CSV
- Ready-to-run in Jupyter Notebook.

2. Basic Circuit Theorem: Voltage Divider
Contains:
- Circuit diagrams
- Simulation reference
- Equivalent circuit representations
- Real measurement data
- Images + oscilloscope screenshots

3. Measurement Comparison: DMM vs PyVISA
Table includes:
- Actual component values
- DMM readings
- PyVISA readings
- Matching values to prove DAQ accuracy

4. Potentiometer Variable Resistance → Voltage Measurement
For both DMM and PyVISA, you provide:
