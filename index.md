# OKB-1 Creative Design Bureau
Welcome to my official GitHub Pages site. This site is for listing all of my engineering products and designs for both young professionals as well as engineering students. This repo also linked to other datasets and CAD files on-sale for download by the fellow engineers or everybody eager to learn getting into engineering major.

# My Products
## NACA 2R1 Airfoil Reconstruction Project — Me 109 Wing Geometry (Research Archive)
[Product Technical Description](https://okb1creativedesignbureau-spec.github.io/OKB-1_Creative_Design_Bureau/products/Bf-109-NACA-2R1.html)

This repository documents my complete reconstruction of the NACA 2R1-derived airfoil family used on the Messerschmitt Bf 109 wing. 
No ready-made datasets existed. No clean coordinate files. No standard NACA profiles. Only scattered photocopies, blurry museum scans, 
and partial references. So for one month, I rebuilt everything from zero — point by point — using a mix of mathematics, 
digitization, and mechanical engineering workflow. The result is a clean, professional-grade dataset of all major airfoil sections:

- 14.2% Root
- 12.8% Mid (Bf 109 E / Emil)
- 12.9% Mid (Bf 109 G / Gustav)
- 11.35% Tip (Late)
- 11.0% Tip (Early)

Each section now exists as:
- Plotted Excel sheets
- Clean XY coordinate lists
- CSV geometry (upper/lower)
- CAD models (DWG / STEP / STL)
- Reference diagrams & documentation
